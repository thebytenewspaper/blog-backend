Hi, hello, thank you for joining Rosshall Records! By now you’ve probably been debriefed by me (Akrit) or Miss Rowbottom in person or over a teams call about what this club is about and what you do in it. This post is basically a quick ‘cheat sheet’ on things you may have forgotten or misunderstood when you were debriefed. (By the way, before we begin, if you’ve not had your debriefing with us then don’t worry, it should be soon!)

Rosshall Records is a blog site and also a club, in the club we write either creative pieces or articles about anything that we have an interest about, this club is really here to help you unlock your creative potential. It’s not a serious or strict club, we want you to have fun and enjoy writing. Each week or so you write an article and it gets published to the site according to the upload schedule.

![Image with text 'We respect your privacy'](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1613987750911-f768497fb94b?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80)

A run down on the privacy bit. The only thing viewers will see is you name (ideally only first name, you can set this up on glow blogs) and profile picture – for more information find me or Miss Rowbottom. You need to be careful about what is in your articles, don’t post your or anyone else’s home address because no one wants stalkers stopping by at their house! Same with profile pictures or pictures on an article, you represent the school when you are online so don’t post any pictures of yourself or anyone else (for privacy concerns) or anything inappropriate (because, like I said, you’re representing the school).

When writing about a controversial topic, generally stay on the neutral side, aka show both sides of the argument or don’t bias one side over the other. It’s a controversial topic and your posting online so steer clear of being on ‘sides’.

The link to our website is here (it’s counter intuitive because you’re viewing this article on the site but its here anyway)!

One last thing I want to say before I finish is. When writing an article… Be confident, I know it’s sometimes scary writing something that you know your friends and family will see but ‘Own the spotlight’ and be confident, it’ll channel through in your work. But, along with that, be yourself and write like that.

Now, I hard coded this site from start to finish, I know the ins and outs of everything on this site and on glow blogs. If you’ve had me debrief you on how to use the site then I’m sure I overloaded you with tonnes and tonnes of tips, tricks, methods and how-to’s on using the website. So… I created how-to guides to help you in case you’re stuck on something. If these videos don’t help then ask me for help. But, first watch these videos before coming to me help only. They should answer most questions.

The link to the [secret how to site](https://designer-website.github.io/rosshall/rosshallrecords.blog/howto.html)!!! (It’s secret so don’t go giving this link to everyone)

Thanks again for joining and I can’t wait to read your brilliant articles!!!
