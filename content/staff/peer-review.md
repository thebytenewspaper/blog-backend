Once you feel your article is ready, it undergoes several checks:

- Spelling and grammar
- Providing necessary metadata (title, description, cover image, etc.)
- Ensuring content complies with our code of conduct

After these checks, your article is posted to the 'peer-review' channel on Discord. It must receive **at least 3 votes** from other writers before it can be published. This simple process serves as our quality control mechanism.

Peer review offers you constructive feedback to improve your article. By gathering perspectives from different writers, you can gauge its impact and make any necessary adjustments before publication.

**While we expect high-quality articles from our writers, this process ensures that each piece meets our standards. Those who vote for your work will be credited as endorsers in the post metadata, adding internal credibility to your article.**
