As members of The Byte community, we strive to uphold the values of integrity, respect, and authenticity in all our endeavors. Our code of conduct serves as a guiding framework to ensure that every article published on our platform reflects these principles and contributes positively to our community. Below are the conduct guidelines we adhere to:

##### Do No Harm

- Each article written must not harm individuals. Contrary to popular belief, words can inflict as much damage as physical weapons.
- Writers must actively ensure that their articles are respectful towards individuals mentioned and consider the potential impact on their morale.
- While criticism towards abstract associations is permissible to argue a point, any critique of individuals must be approached with sensitivity and empathy.

##### Truthfulness

- Each article must be factually accurate. In an era where misinformation proliferates, we prioritize truthfulness in all our content.
- Writers are expected to verify statements and evidence with valid and credible sources, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- While citations are not mandatory for creative pieces, including sources where applicable is encouraged to maintain transparency and credibility.

##### Originality and Plagiarism

- Each article must be free from obvious plagiarism. In an age of AI-generated content and widespread information dissemination, we prioritize originality and attribution.
- While acknowledging the challenge of producing entirely novel content, intentional plagiarism is strictly prohibited.
- Our peer review process helps identify and rectify any instances of potential plagiarism before publication, fostering a culture of academic honesty and respect for intellectual property.

**At The Byte, we are committed to fostering a community where creativity flourishes, ideas are shared responsibly, and individuals are treated with dignity and respect. By adhering to these conduct guidelines, we uphold the integrity of our platform and contribute to a positive and enriching environment for all.**
