Every article **must have**:
- a chosen title
- a short description / blurb (no more than 50 words)
- a cover photo as well as attribution text (so we can credit the photographer)
- the main content of your article (it has no maximum or minimum length, is shall be as long as you feel)
- articles must be provided in document format i.e. google docs basic export, microsoft word file, pdf etc

Improving Accessibility:
- provide alt text for every image used
- if you choose custom formatting, ensure that colours used contrast well for readability
- provide alt text for links used
